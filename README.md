# Mobile Manipulation with MoveIt 2 and Stretch 

This documentation is for the [ROS World 2021](https://roscon.ros.org/world/2021/) tutorial from [PickNik](https://picknik.ai/) and [Hello Robot](https://hello-robot.com/). You'll learn how to use [MoveIt 2](https://moveit.ros.org/) for mobile manipulation with the [Stretch RE1 mobile manipulator](https://hello-robot.com/product) from Hello Robot.

# Software Installation

Prior to the workshop, you need to install software in order to actively try things out. **We strongly recommend the Docker-based installation**, but we also provide instructions for installation from source.

<a name="linux_docker_install"/>

## Linux Installation (with Docker)

### Install Docker

Install docker, following the [official installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository) and verify your installation. Follow the instructions under "Install using the repository" and the stable release.

### Docker post-install steps

Follow the [official post-installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user) for Linux allow non-root users to manage dockers and verify your post installation. Be sure to reboot after running the commands.

### Check if you have an Nvidia GPU

Now, check if your machine has an Nvidia GPU. If it does, you need to follow the Docker Nvidia installation instructions. **The non-Nvidia installation will fail if you have an Nvidia GPU.**

Install nvidia-docker2 if you have an Nvidia GPU. Follow the [official instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#setting-up-nvidia-container-toolkit). Install nvidia-docker2 and verify your installation.

### Getting Started with a Docker Container for Stretch

We provide a pre-built docker image and a set of scripts to easily get you up and running with Stretch on docker! To get your docker running with UI and networking enabled:

1\. Fetch our start_docker script. This fetches the script to your current directory. Remember where it is so you can come back to it.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hello-robot/stretch_ros2/ros_world2021/docker/scripts/start_docker.sh
```

2\. Start your container from our pre-built image

with an nvidia-gpu:

```bash
chmod +x start_docker.sh && \
./start_docker.sh stretch_roscon ghcr.io/hello-robot/stretch_ros2:rosworld2021
```

without an nvidia-gpu:

```bash
chmod +x start_docker.sh && \
./start_docker.sh stretch_roscon ghcr.io/hello-robot/stretch_ros2:rosworld2021 nogpu
```
You should now be in the `~/ws_stretch/src/` directory. If you type `ls`, you should see a number of directories, including `stretch_ros2` and `stretch_moveit_plugins`.  

You can access the same container from multiple terminals. For example, you can open a new terminal and run `./start_docker.sh stretch_roscon` to access a running container.

You can leave the container at any time by typing `exit` in a terminal. To find out if a container is running, you can open a new terminal and type `docker ps`. 

3\. Test the container by running a simulation of the robot Stretch. First, make sure you are accessing the container via a terminal.

Now you can test the container by bringing up Stretch in Ignition Gazebo by issuing the following set of commands inside your container:

```bash
ros2 launch stretch_ignition ignition.launch.py
```

Congratulations! You brought up Stretch in Ignition Gazebo! Now you should be seeing Stretch in Ignition Gazebo with an empty world around it:

## Updating the Docker Image

If you would like to update your docker image you can start by pulling the latest docker image with

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/hello-robot/stretch_ros2:rosworld2021
```

and remove the previous container so you can start a new one with the same name with the following command with NVIDIA GPU:

```bash
docker container rm stretch_roscon && ./start_docker.sh stretch_roscon ghcr.io/hello-robot/stretch_ros2:rosworld2021
```

or without an NVIDIA gpu:

```bash
docker container rm stretch_roscon && ./start_docker.sh stretch_roscon ghcr.io/hello-robot/stretch_ros2:rosworld2021 nogpu
```

## Linux Installation (Source)

The following instructions assume you have an Ubuntu 20.04 based installation of Linux.

### Install ROS 2 Galactic

# Guided Explorations

The ROS World tutorial will include several guided explorations, which we describe below.

<a name="moveit_config_demo"/>

## stretch_moveit_config Demo

* Make sure you don't have anything running in your docker terminal and run the following commands in two different terminal windows. In each terminal, the commands start by running our docker script to connect to the same container instance. If the terminal is already connected to the container instance, you don't need to run the script.

  ```bash
  # Terminal 1
  ./start_docker.sh stretch_roscon
  ros2 launch stretch_ignition ignition.launch.py
  ```
  ```bash
  # Terminal 2
  ./start_docker.sh stretch_roscon
  ros2 launch stretch_moveit_config demo.launch.py
  ```

* Show how to plan from current state to (1) random valid goal state or (2) a specific state by moving the interactive marker. The latter may not always work, because some planning groups are kinematically very constrained.

<img src="./images/interactive_marker.png" alt="Interactive Marker with Stretch" width="300"/>

* Repeat the previous step for the `stretch_arm` and `mobile_base_arm` groups.

![Planning Group Selection](./images/planning_group.png) 

* Turn on "Query Start State" by checking the checkbox in the Displays panel under "Motion Planning > Planning Request".

![Displays Panel Motion Planning Options](./images/displays_panel_motionplanning_improved.png) 

* Turn on "Loop animation" by checking the checkbox in the Displays panel under "Trajectory."

![Displays Panel Trajectory Options](./images/displays_panel_trajectory.png) 

* Explain structure of `stretch_moveit_config`; show contents of some configuration files and maybe SRDF/URDF.

<a name="ignition_demo"/>

## Ignition Demo World

Run the following commands in three different terminal windows. In each terminal, the commands start by running our docker script to connect to the same container instance. If the terminal is already connected to the container instance, you don't need to run the script.

  ```bash
  # Terminal 1
  ./start_docker.sh stretch_roscon
  ros2 launch stretch_ignition ignition.launch.py
  ```
  ```bash
  # Terminal 2
  ./start_docker.sh stretch_roscon
  ros2 launch stretch_moveit_config demo_ignition.launch.py
  ```
  ```bash
  # Terminal 3
  ./start_docker.sh stretch_roscon
  ros2 launch stretch_roscon_demos move_group_interface_demo.launch.py
  ```
  
After executing these commands, you should see the simulation window (Ignition) and an RViz window that displays sensor information. 

<img src="./images/ignition_1.png" alt="Ignition" height="200"/>

<img src="./images/rviz_1.png" alt="RViz" height="200"/>

You will press the `Next` button in the RViz window to make the robot move through a series of actions. 

![RViz Next Button](./images/rviz_next.png) 

<a name="task_constructor_demo"/>

## Pick and Place with MoveIt Task Constructor

Run the following commands in two different terminal windows. In each terminal, the commands start by running our docker script to connect to the same container instance. If the terminal is already connected to the container instance, you don't need to run the script.

  ```bash
  # Terminal 1
  ./start_docker.sh stretch_roscon
  ros2 launch pick_place_task demo.launch.py
  ```
  ```bash
  # Terminal 2
  ./start_docker.sh stretch_roscon
  ros2 launch pick_place_task pick_place_demo.launch.py 
  ```

* Explain MTC panel. Show different solutions.
* Explain structure of the code.

You should see a terminal with task-related information in text and an RViz window. 

<img src="./images/rviz_2.png" alt="RViz" height="200"/>

<a name="whole_body_planning"/>

## Pick and Place with Whole Body Planning

  ```bash
  # Terminal 1
  ./start_docker.sh stretch_roscon
  ros2 launch stretch_ignition ignition.launch.py aws:=true
  ```
  ```bash
  # Terminal 2
  ./start_docker.sh stretch_roscon
  ros2 launch stretch_moveit_config demo_ignition.launch.py
  ```

You should see a more complex simulation environment that uses assets from AWS in the Ignition window and an RViz window showing the robot's state.

## Editing the Source Code During the Workshop

Our docker image comes with a pre-built installation of vim, nano and emacs. You can also install your editor of choice via apt-get.
